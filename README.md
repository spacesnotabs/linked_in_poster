This tool is meant to help someone create LinkedIn posts in their own style using either local or online LLMs.

I _love_ using AI to help me write code.  I will be the first to admit that.  It feels like magic and can be extremely helpful!  However, for this project, I wanted to learn how to work with both local LLMs and LLM APIs and the best way for me to learn is to write the code myself.  I definitely consulted various online sources - in particular LLMs - to aid in my learning.  But, I am writing the code myself to ensure I'm understanding how it all works.

This project has just begun so as of this writing, all it does is fire up a specific Mistral model on your machine and give you a command-line chat interface!  Over time, I'll use that framework to build what this tool is intended to be.
